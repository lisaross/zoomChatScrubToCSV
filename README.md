# Zoom Chat Transcript to CSV Converter

This script converts exported Zoom chat transcripts into a CSV format, extracting timestamps and associated messages. Converting the transcripts into a CSV format allows for easy data analysis and readability. In order to maintain privacy and confidentiality, user names are omitted from the output. The original file will be replaced by the new CSV file, which will have the same filename prefix but with a `.csv` extension.

ðŸš¨ Note: this will overwrite your original chat download.
